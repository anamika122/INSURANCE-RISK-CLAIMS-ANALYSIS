# INSURANCE-RISK-CLAIMS-ANALYSIS
Built an end-to-end SQL project analyzing 37K+ insurance records. Conducted demographic and vehicle-based risk profiling to study claim frequency, severity, and income patterns. Identified high-risk groups (young drivers, commercial usage, old vehicles) and profitable segments (safe drivers, high-income households).
